# QB-API
A **REST API** for accessing quiz bowl questions and answers, developed with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** and implementing **Model-View-Controller**/Model-Route-Controller (**MVC**/MRC) architecture.

## How do you access it?
QB-API can be accessed in two ways: on a web server URI or locally.

### Server

QB-API can be accessed via a (free) server for web services hosted by Render at the following URI: 

**https://qb-api-onrender.com/api/questions**

Because of the free status of this server, there are limitations to calling it, and it make take a while for the server to spin up again.

### Locally

QB-API can be locally by cloning this repository and running the following command: 

`npm run serve`

It will then be run on port 3000 of the local host via `localhost:3000/api/questions`. 

Note that you must add the variable `MONGO_URI` (which comes from your own MongoDB database configuration) to a `.env` file to access the DB. You can also add `PORT` if you want to change it from 3000, `FRONTEND` if you want to add a frontend, and `NODE_ENV` if you want to change it to `development` and see error codes.

#### Insomnia

Insomnia is useful and easy tool for configuring and displaying the various possible calls to the API. Download it from https://insomnia.rest/download.

## How to use this API?

Numerous CRUD/HTTP methods can be used with this API. Each time the API is called, a JSON object is returned.

### Question JSON Structure

The JSON structure of the questions stored in the DB and accessible via the API is the following (also seen in `/models/questionModel.js` in the repository): 

```
{
    difficulty: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    category: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    question: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    answer: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    source: { // i.e. from protobowl, QANTA, quizbowlpackets scraper, manually added, etc.
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    tournament: String,
    round: String,
    num: Number,
    year: Number, 
}
```

### Methods

The following methods can be used:

### Get

You can get (read) a single question with ID `id` by calling with a `get` request: `/api/questions/id`.

You can also get (read) randomly selected questions stored in the database by calling with a `get` request: `/api/questions/`. By default, the number of questions chosen is 3, but you can get a different amount `N` via the following query string: `api/questions?size=N`.

You can also get (read) random questions of a specific category `category` stored in the database by calling with a `get` request: `/api/categories/category`. By default, the number of questions chosen is 3, but you can get a different amount `N` via the following query string: `/api/categories/category?size=N`.

### Post

You can post (create) a single question JSON object by calling with a `post` request: `/api/questions/`.

### Put

You can put (update) a single question JSON object with ID `id` by calling with a `put` request: `/api/questions/id`.

### Delete

You can delete a single question JSON object with ID `id` by calling with a `delete` request: `/api/questions/id`

## Further Work

To add to this API, further work is needed to sync the categories storied in the API with the categories in the stored questions. Additionally, authorization can be added to secure the API and the various methods. Finally, more work is needed in streamlining the API calls and the `get` requests for questions as the size of the question DB scales up dramatically.
